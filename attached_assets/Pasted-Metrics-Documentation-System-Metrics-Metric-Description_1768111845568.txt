SAI Layer Metrics
Collection Details:

Source: SAI-Redis (Redis database 4) and COUNTERS_DB (Redis database 2)
Frequency: Every 10 seconds (real-time collection)
Purpose: ASIC-level telemetry data for link failure detection, congestion monitoring, and hardware-level visibility
Data Format: Prometheus text format

System and Status Metrics:

Metric	Description	Type	Labels

Note: SAI metrics are collected from SAI-Redis (Redis database 4) and COUNTERS_DB (Redis database 2) every 10 seconds in real-time. These metrics provide ASIC-level telemetry data and complement the port-level metrics by providing deeper visibility into the switch hardware. The metrics are optimized for link failure detection and congestion monitoring use cases.
